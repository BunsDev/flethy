Marketing is an essential part of any product. An essential prerequisite is to know for whom marketing is necessary. For this, marketing services exist that manage customers, tools for classifying them, and ways to send marketing materials through various channels.

One service in this category is Hubspot. Use Hubspot to create new contacts in the system via the API. As an absolute minimum, only the email address is necessary. In addition, various attributes can be added that are useful for the user entry.

flethy offers a very simple way to create contacts in Hubspot. Just configure the node accordingly with the event information and the API key and the flethy engine takes care of the rest.
